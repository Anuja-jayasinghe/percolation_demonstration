# percolation_demonstration
This Python program demonstrates how percolation happens in a simple manner



---
Percolation is the procedure of a liquid deliberately passing through a filter.
Examples: Movement of weather material under the earth's surface, Coffee percolation, spread of 
diseases.

this program helps to better understand the concept of how random and 
unpredictable the percolations are.

perc_functions.py is the module containing the Python functions required to demonstrate the percolation this module is in the percolation_fun package and percolation.py is the main program used to run the program 


This program shows percolation using a grid and also saves it to txt file and an html file so you can view it in Notepad and web browser.
